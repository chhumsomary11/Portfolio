          Achievements are essential milestones that drive personal and
          professional growth. My journey in university has brought so much
          changes for me. Along the way, the extra curriculum, minor milestones,
          and experiences are the tools that drive me to become what I have
          become today. Below are the lists of achievement and awards I have
          received so far.

              <br />One of my most significant accomplishments is earning a
              scholarship to study Information Communication Technology (ICT) at
              the American University of Phnom Penh (AUPP). This opportunity has
              fueled my passion for learning, expanded my professional network,
              and strengthened my determination to excel in the ever-evolving
              digital world.

              <br />
              During this volunteer work, I have gained lots of experiences and
              new insight. Those works include helping with registering process
              for scholarship students as well as helping out with events.

              I was also certified with an journalist certification.
